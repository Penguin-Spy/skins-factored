error-skin-removed=[img=utility/danger_icon] WARNING: A skin a player was using has been removed from the game (__1__ was using the skin '__2__'). THIS WILL DELETE THEIR INVENTORY and SOFTLOCK THEM in the spectator camera!\nTo prevent this, quit the game WITHOUT SAVING, re-enable the mod that added the '__2__' skin, load this save again, have the player change their skin to the Engineer, and then save & remove the mod again.\nIf you didn't intentionally remove any skin mods, check the Factorio logs for errors and check the changelogs of all your skin mods.
